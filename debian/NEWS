encfs (1.7.4-4) unstable; urgency=medium

  * There is a security audit report available on
    https://defuse.ca/audits/encfs.htm
    which identifies some security issues in encfs. Many of them affect the
    retrieval of encrypted data from unsafe storage which could have been
    manipulated by an attacker and have some impact on data retrieval or on
    future encryption operation, like adding zero bytes blocks inside of real
    data, or disabling MACs via configuration file (lowering the encryption
    complexity for subsequently added data). Some attacks affect the
    encryption mechanism (potential timing analysis of MACs, stream cipher is
    used to encrypt the last file block while generating block IV by XORing
    the block number).

    Some users should reconsider the use of encfs for sensitive data in
    environments which allow situations like those described on the mentioned
    website.

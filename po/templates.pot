"According to a security audit by Taylor Hornby (Defuse Security), the "
"current implementation of Encfs is vulnerable or potentially vulnerable to "
"multiple types of attacks. For example, an attacker with read/write access "
"to encrypted data might lower the decryption complexity for subsequently "
"encrypted data without being noticed or compute encryption information by "
"timing analysis."

"Until these security issues are solved, encfs should not be considered a "
"safe home for sensitive data in certain environments and this package should "
"be used only for retrieval of information from previously encrypted sources."

"According to a security audit by Taylor Hornby (Defuse Security), the "
"current implementation of Encfs is vulnerable or potentially vulnerable to "
"multiple attacks on the encrypted data. This especially affects use cases "
"where the attacker has read/write access to the encrypted directory or has "
"enough knowledge of the unencrypted file system contents."

"Considering the current situation, encfs should not be considered a safe "
"home for sensible data. This package should be only used to retrieve "
"information from previously encrypted sources, and even this action contains "
"some risk of receiving compromised data."
